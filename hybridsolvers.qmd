# Hybrid solvers

Even though we talked about Quantum Computers and how we can use them to solve specific problems, complex problems; what percentage of the problem is solved by each device (classical and quantum) depends on the specific problem we would like to solve. 

Think about Shor's algorithm. It revolutionized the field and worried a couple of CSO/CISOs in the way. But it only changes one little step from the conventions Factorization algorithm.
