# Preface {.unnumbered}

You may wonder, another book about Quantum Computing? More documentation? We already have:

* [Qiskit documentation](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/hello-world)
* DWave's documentation around [optimization](https://docs.dwavequantum.com/en/latest/index.html)
* Pennylane for [QML and simulation](https://pennylane.ai/qml) and [codebooks](https://pennylane.ai/codebook/learning-paths)
* Even some relevant works that go in detail on this, books and stuff [@dewolf2023quantumcomputinglecturenotes; @nielsen2010quantum; @yanofsky2008quantum]

Well, by telling it from a different perspective it may help people coming from different fields (meaning, non-physicists) grasp the idea behind quantum computing. This is also a work for myself, as it will definitely help me better understand some of the concepts. Just by explaining things I found it is the best way to challenge ones knowledge about a field you are trying to master.

Also, it costs nothing so, no harm done. Code snippets are easier to maintain so hopefully, everything will work with the latest versions. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I have learned creating it.

## About me

Mi name is Iraitz Montalb√°n, Computer Scientist by background, I started in the field of Quantum Computing by chance, while doing an internship in 2010 there were some guys doing something called _quantum computing_, which was a mathematical framework back then. I kept my interest in the field and ended up doing a masters on Quantum Computing Technologies at UPM and working with some startups in the field.
