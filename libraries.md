# Software packages

* [QuTip](https://qutip.org/): Quantum Toolbox for simulating the dynamics of quantum systems.
* [Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit): IBM's development kit, the indisputable standard for gate-based quantum software development.
* [Ocean SDK](https://www.dwavequantum.com/solutions-and-products/ocean/): D-Wave proprietary SDK. Really useful for problem posing and creating the first instances of our particular instances before moving to annealers, gate-based devices or whatever might be the final solver.
* QuEra's **Bloqade** for simulating Neutral Atom platforms both in [Julia](https://queracomputing.github.io/Bloqade.jl/dev/) and [Python](https://queracomputing.github.io/bloqade-analog/latest/)
* [Amazon Braket](https://aws.amazon.com/es/braket/) for simulation and sending jobs to Amazon Braket service.
* [Pennylane SDK](https://pennylane.ai/) for Quantum Machine Learning, among other topics.
* [QUIMB](https://quimb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for those wanting to get deep into Tensor Network _stuff_.
